### Disclaimer
Yes yes, i know how irresponsible it is to upload my pk (ssl key) to GitHub, but I don't care - this domain expires in Febuary and the key in June so I don't really care

### Deployment
Create a host with Debian/Ubuntu/Whatever and install docker-ce, then run `run.sh`

#### Or
Run a self-contained docker thingy with `contained.sh`
