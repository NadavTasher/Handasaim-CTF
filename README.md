# HandasaimCTF

### Disclaimer
Yes yes, i know how irresponsible it is to upload my pk (ssl key) to GitHub, but I don't care - this domain expires in Febuary and the key in June so I don't really care

### Deployment
Create a host with Debian/Ubuntu/Whatever and install docker-ce, then run `run.sh`

#### Or
Run a self-contained docker thingy with `run-contained.sh`

## What's HandasaimCTF?
HandasaimCTF is a cybersecurity competition I made for my school (Handasaim), which I intend to turn in as my 5 point bagrut project.

## Challenges
### 0. Infrastructure
I wrote this infrastructure for the CTF

#### 1. DogePass
This challenge is relatively easy - it gives you a black page, with black text, and you have to use `Ctrl+A` to select the flag.
